# GitHub Export Guide for Nodeifi DAO Platform

Since Replit's Git integration is having issues, here's how to manually sync your project with GitHub:

## Method 1: Download Project Files (Recommended)

1. **Download your project files:**
   - In Replit, go to the file explorer
   - Click the three dots (⋯) next to your project name
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - This downloads all your project files

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/NODEIFI/NodeifiWebsite-from-template
   - Click "uploading an existing file" or drag and drop
   - Upload the extracted files from your zip

## Method 2: Manual File Copy

1. **Create these essential files first in your GitHub repo:**

**.gitignore:**
```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
.pnpm-store/

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# Environment files
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Database
*.db
*.sqlite

# Logs
logs/
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Replit specific
.replit
replit.nix
.breakpoints
.upm/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

2. **Copy key files manually:**
   - package.json
   - All files in client/
   - All files in server/
   - All files in shared/
   - vite.config.ts
   - tailwind.config.ts
   - postcss.config.js
   - drizzle.config.ts
   - replit.md

## Deployment on Railway/Render

1. **Connect your GitHub repo to Railway:**
   - Go to Railway.app
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Add PostgreSQL database addon

2. **Set environment variables:**
   - Add DATABASE_URL (Railway provides this automatically)
   - Add any API keys you need

3. **Deploy:**
   - Railway will automatically build and deploy
   - Run `npm run db:push` to set up database tables

## Your Project is Ready!

Your Nodeifi DAO Platform includes:
- ✅ Full-stack React + Express setup
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Blockchain governance integration
- ✅ Performance monitoring system
- ✅ All dependencies properly configured

The app is currently running perfectly on port 5000 in Replit!
